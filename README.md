🗂 Project Overview

📌 Introduction
This project explores and analyzes a comprehensive e-commerce dataset . The dataset includes detailed attributes such as shipping modes,
order regions, profit margins, delivery statuses, and customer segments.
The primary goal is to uncover operational inefficiencies, regional trends, and profitability patterns to support business decision-making and strategic improvements.

The analysis is divided into three main sections:

Basic Analysis – Overview of shipping modes, country order volumes, and profit over time.

Advanced Analysis – Filtered views of top products and performance by delivery status, region, and time.

Smart Analysis – Deep-dive into shipping delays, profitability by product and segment, and risk patterns.

🔍 Key Insights
Logistics & Delivery
Standard Class is the most used shipping mode, suggesting customer preference for balanced cost/speed.

Shipping delays are notably higher in regions like Central and Oceania.

Same-Day and First-Class modes sometimes exceed scheduled delivery times, revealing potential scheduling issues.

Profitability & Losses
Not all orders are profitable – a significant number yield losses, especially in certain regions.

Top 10 loss-making products highlight areas for inventory or pricing strategy review.

Customer Segment profitability shows that some segments (like Home Office) consistently yield higher returns.

Operational Risk
Late delivery risk varies across regions, indicating logistic performance issues in specific markets.

Shipping efficiency fluctuates monthly, suggesting seasonality or operational variance.

✅ Outcomes & Recommendations
Focus on regional logistics optimization: Invest in improving delivery networks in high-risk regions.

Revise pricing or discontinue underperforming products that repeatedly incur losses.

Segment-targeted strategies: Prioritize profitable customer segments in marketing and promotions.

Review and tighten shipping schedules, especially for Same-Day and First-Class shipments.
